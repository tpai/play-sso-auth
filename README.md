## Prerequisites

Install dependencies and create `.env` file.

```
yarn
```

And make sure to write something to `JWT_TOKEN` of `.env`.

## Usage

Launch two server as cross domain server.

```
yarn run deploy
```

Using IP address is for a reason that cookies do not provide isolation for different ports.

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
http://localhost:8081
```

For protecting your cookies, make sure to add `HttpOnly` and `secure` flag for preventing XSS and MITM in production.
